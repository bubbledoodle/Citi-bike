# Citi-bike
## Basic ideas
This is an analysis of Citi bike sharing program, which operate in NYC. Of all Citi bike stations, we want to know each station's user age distribution. So that targeting to different user age group, we can promote different types of information to them. As to custimize information sharing at each the station. Using open data, we keep the list of each starting station's user age and conduct simple statisical analysis. We will then present each station's maxmum user age, minmum user age, and average user age.
The analysis contains data from January 2016 to October 2016.  

## Footprint of the project
1. Process the raw data -------> created csv file contains each starting station name & statisics of user age information
2. Future work: i. integrated with map and cooradinates
		ii. each station should build a histogram
		iii. possibly set up a webset for this Data-visualization project
